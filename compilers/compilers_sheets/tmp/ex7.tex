Suppose x is at offset -4 from the frame pointer and y is at offset -8 from the frame pointer. \\
Code without movm:

\begin{lstlisting}
ldr r0, [fp, #-8]
str r0, [fp, #-4]
\end{lstlisting}

Code with movm:

\begin{lstlisting}
sub r0, fp, #8
sub r1, fp, #4
movm [r1], [r2]
\end{lstlisting}

So under the assumptions given, the code with movm is 50\% worse than the code without it.

Suppose x and y are local pointers to pointers to integers, again at offests -4 and -8, and we want to compile \texttt{!!x := !!y}.
Code without movm:

\begin{lstlisting}
ldr r0, [fp, #-8]
ldr r1, [fp, #-4]
ldr r1, [r1]
str r1, [r0]
\end{lstlisting}

Code with movm:

\begin{lstlisting}
ldr r0, [fp, #-8]
ldr r1, [fp, #-4]
movm [r1], [r0]
\end{lstlisting}
