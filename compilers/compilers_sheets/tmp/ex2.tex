Assume pointers are 4 bytes and aligned to 4 bytes, and integers are 4 bytes and aligned to 4 bytes. \\
The record layout will be thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 bytes for \texttt{data}
\item 4 bytes for \texttt{next}
\end{itemize}
and the record will be 4 byte aligned. \\

Suppose that the stack layout is thus:

\begin{itemize}
\item at fp - 8, the second local variable byte (supposijng it is 4 bytes long)
\item at fp - 4, the first local variable (supposing it is 4 bytes long)
\item at fp, the dynamic link
\item at fp + 4, the return address
\item at fp + 8, the beginning of the procedure currenty being run
\item at fp + 12, the static link
\item at fp + 16, the first argument
\item at fp + 20, the second argument
\item ...
\end{itemize}
