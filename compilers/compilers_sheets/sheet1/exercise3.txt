Since the difference between two regular sets is also regular, the set of all strings that do not match our keywords must be regular, and all regular sets are descriabable by regular expressions. Thus, we can build a regular expression that matches only strings different to the keywords. However, this seems much more difficult than the method currently used -- as the method currently used is trivial, while building a regular expression that does not match some regular language seems not to be.
