Assume that both pointers and integers are 4 bytes long and are aligned to 4 bytes. \\
The record layout will be thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 bytes for \texttt{data}
\item 4 bytes for \texttt{next}
\end{itemize}
and the record will be 4 byte aligned. \\

One possible layout for the stack frame of $sum$ is:

\begin{itemize}
\item at fp + 16, the parameter $p$
\item at fp + 12, the static link
\item at fp + 8, the code adress where $sum$ begins.
\item at fp + 4, the return address
\item at fp, the dynamic link
\item at fp - 4, the pointer $q$
\item at fp - 8, the integer $s$
\end{itemize}

Where fp is the frame pointer.
