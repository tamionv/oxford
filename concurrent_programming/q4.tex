Not necessarily. Consider the following execution path:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\texttt{p} & \texttt{q} & Value of \texttt{x} & Value of \texttt{y} \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 1 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 2 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 3 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 4 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 5 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 6 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 7 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 8 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), set x = x+1 & & 9 & 10 \\
\hline
Test if (x = y), get x & & 9 & 10 \\
\hline
 & Test if (x = y), get y & 9 & 10 \\
\hline
Set x to x+1 & & 10 & 10 \\
\hline
 & Set y to y-1 & 10 & 9 \\
\hline
    ... & ... & ... &... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

From here execution will continue at least until overflow occurs. When that happens, a sequence like the one above can still occur again, making it possible for the process to execute forever.
