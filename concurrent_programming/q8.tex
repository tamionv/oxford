To achieve this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort $a$.
\item Instantiate some number of workers.
\item Split $b$ into a number of chunks equal to the number of available workers.
\item Send each worker a chunk of $b$.
\item Each worker now finds, for each $x$ in its chunk of $b$, the number of times $x$ appears in $a$, using binary search.
\item Each worker sends it's result back to the controller, which sums these to find the overall result.
\end{enumerate}
